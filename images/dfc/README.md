## What are Chainguard Containers?

[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/containers?utm_source=readmes) are minimal container images that are secure by default. 

In many cases, the Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Containers are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with a `-dev` variant.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to leverage the `-dev` variants, copying application artifacts into a final minimal container that offers a reduced attack surface that wonâ€™t allow package installations or logins.
