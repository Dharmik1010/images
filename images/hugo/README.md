# Chainguard Container for hugo

This is a minimal [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) image.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/hugo:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Application Setup for End Users

The following is an example of using the Hugo image locally. It's based on the official [Hugo "quickstart"](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#commands) example.

To begin, start a shell in the Hugo developer (dev) container.

```shell
docker run -v $PWD/data:/home/data --entrypoint=/bin/sh -p 8080:8080 -it \
cgr.dev/chainguard/hugo:latest-dev
```

Create a new Hugo site using the quickstart commands.

```shell
hugo new site quickstart
```

Navigate into the new site's root directory.

```shell
cd quickstart
```

Initiate an empty Git repository 

```shell
git init
```

Clone a Hugo theme into the `themes` directory. 

```shell
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke themes/ananke
```

Add a line to the site's configuration file to let Hugo know to use the new theme.

```shell
echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
```

Start the Hugo development server to serve the site. Be sure to change the default bind address and port to make the site accessible outside of the container.

```shell
hugo serve --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Now open your browser to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to visit the sample site.

When finished, you can press `CTRL + C` to stop the Hugo server from running, and then `CTRL + D` to exit the container shell.

## What are Chainguard Containers?

[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/containers?utm_source=readmes) are minimal container images that are secure by default. 

In many cases, the Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Containers are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with a `-dev` variant.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to leverage the `-dev` variants, copying application artifacts into a final minimal container that offers a reduced attack surface that wonâ€™t allow package installations or logins.
