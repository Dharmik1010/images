# Chainguard Container for jre

Minimalist Wolfi-based Java JRE image using [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/). Used for running Java applications.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.

## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/jre:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes

Like most available alternatives, Chainguard's JRE image is built directly from the [OpenJDK project](https://openjdk.org/). The Chainguard JRE image has few-to-zero CVEs and does not run as the root user.

## Getting Started

A JRE is the standard runtime for a Java application and is used for running an already developed and packaged Java application. Generally, you will combine your application with the Chainguard JRE image and Docker or a build tool like [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

### Using Jib to build a JRE-based application image

Using Maven or Gradle, you can compile and package your application. [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master) is a tool from Google Container Tools which builds optimized Docker and OCI images for Java applications. It's available as a plugin for both Maven and Gradle, as well as a Java library. 

The Jib GitHub repository includes [a useful example application](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/examples/spring-boot) that works with Maven or Gradle.

### Using Helm to Deploy your Java Application

Using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to deploy your JRE-based application image is relatively straightforward using either [this Kubernetes Service Helm Chart](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/blob/main/charts/k8s-service/README.md) or [this Service Helm Chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/kvalitetsit/service) from ArtifactHub.

## What are Chainguard Containers?

[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/containers?utm_source=readmes) are minimal container images that are secure by default. 

In many cases, the Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Containers are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with a `-dev` variant.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to leverage the `-dev` variants, copying application artifacts into a final minimal container that offers a reduced attack surface that wonâ€™t allow package installations or logins.
