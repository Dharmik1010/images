# Chainguard Image for grype

A vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems

Chainguard Images are regularly-updated, minimal container images with low-to-zero CVEs.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Image
This image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/grype:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard registry.

## Image Variants

Our `latest` tag uses the most recent build of the [Wolfi grype](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os/blob/main/grype.yaml) package. The following tagged variant is available without authentication:

- `latest`: This is an image for running `grype` commands. It does not include a shell or other applications.

### Compatibility Notes

Chainguard's `grype` image is comparable to the [official grype Image.](hub.docker.com/r/anchore/grype) but with the following changes:
* We use a different entrypoint `/usr/bin/grype` as compared to the upstream's endpoint `/grype`.
* We use a different `CMD` which is `help` whereas the upstream leaves it unset.
* We don't define any WorkingDir whereas the upstream sets it to `/tmp`.

### Getting Started

#### grype help
This will automatically pull the image to your local system and execute the command `grype help`:

```shell
docker run --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/grype help


A vulnerability scanner for container images, filesystems, and SBOMs.

Supports the following image sources:
    grype yourrepo/yourimage:tag             defaults to using images from a Docker daemon
    grype path/to/yourproject                a Docker tar, OCI tar, OCI directory, SIF container, or generic filesystem directory

You can also explicitly specify the scheme to use:
    grype podman:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          explicitly use the Podman daemon
    grype docker:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          explicitly use the Docker daemon
    grype docker-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar   use a tarball from disk for archives created from "docker save"
    grype oci-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar      use a tarball from disk for OCI archives (from Podman or otherwise)
    grype oci-dir:path/to/yourimage              read directly from a path on disk for OCI layout directories (from Skopeo or otherwise)
    grype singularity:path/to/yourimage.sif      read directly from a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container on disk
    grype dir:path/to/yourproject                read directly from a path on disk (any directory)
    grype sbom:path/to/syft.json                 read Syft JSON from path on disk
    grype registry:yourrepo/yourimage:tag        pull image directly from a registry (no container runtime required)
    grype purl:path/to/purl/file                 read a newline separated file of purls from a path on disk

You can also pipe in Syft JSON directly:
	syft yourimage:tag -o json | grype

Usage:
  grype [command]
```

## What are Chainguard Images?

[Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=readmes) are a collection of container images designed for security and minimalism.

Many Chainguard Images are [distroless](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started-distroless/); they contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These images do not even contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview), our Linux _undistro_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Images include:

* Minimal design, with no unnecessary software bloat
* Automated nightly builds to ensure Images are completely up-to-date and contain all available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) (software bills of materials) attesting the provenance of all artifacts within the Image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds))

### `-dev` Variants

As mentioned previously, Chainguard’s distroless Images have no shell or package manager by default. This is great for security, but sometimes you need these things, especially in builder images. For those cases, most (but not all) Chainguard Images come paired with a `-dev` variant which does include a shell and package manager.

Although the `-dev` image variants have similar security features as their distroless versions, such as complete SBOMs and signatures, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. The general recommendation is to use the `-dev` variants only to build the application and then copy all application artifacts into a distroless image, which will result in a final container image that has a minimal attack surface and won’t allow package installations or logins.

That being said, it’s worth noting that `-dev` variants of Chainguard Images are completely fine to run in production environments. After all, the `-dev` variants are still **more secure** than many popular container images based on fully-featured operating systems such as Debian and Ubuntu since they carry less software, follow a more frequent patch cadence, and offer attestations for what they include.
