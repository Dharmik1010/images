# Chainguard Container for dive

Minimal [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) container image.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/dive:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Usage

```
This tool provides a way to discover and explore the contents of a docker image. Additionally the tool estimates
the amount of wasted space and identifies the offending files from the image.

Usage:
  dive [IMAGE] [flags]
  dive [command]

Available Commands:
  build       Builds and analyzes a docker image from a Dockerfile (this is a thin wrapper for the `docker build` command).
  help        Help about any command
  version     print the version number and exit (also --version)

Flags:
      --ci                                Skip the interactive TUI and validate against CI rules (same as env var CI=true)
      --ci-config string                  If CI=true in the environment, use the given yaml to drive validation rules. (default ".dive-ci")
      --config string                     config file (default is $HOME/.dive.yaml, ~/.config/dive/*.yaml, or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dive.yaml)
  -h, --help                              help for dive
      --highestUserWastedPercent string   (only valid with --ci given) highest allowable percentage of bytes wasted (as a ratio between 0-1), otherwise CI validation will fail. (default "0.1")
      --highestWastedBytes string         (only valid with --ci given) highest allowable bytes wasted, otherwise CI validation will fail. (default "disabled")
  -i, --ignore-errors                     ignore image parsing errors and run the analysis anyway
  -j, --json string                       Skip the interactive TUI and write the layer analysis statistics to a given file.
      --lowestEfficiency string           (only valid with --ci given) lowest allowable image efficiency (as a ratio between 0-1), otherwise CI validation will fail. (default "0.9")
      --source string                     The container engine to fetch the image from. Allowed values: docker, podman, docker-archive (default "docker")
  -v, --version                           display version number

Use "dive [command] --help" for more information about a command.

## What are Chainguard Containers?

[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/containers?utm_source=readmes) are minimal container images that are secure by default. 

In many cases, the Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Containers are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with a `-dev` variant.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to leverage the `-dev` variants, copying application artifacts into a final minimal container that offers a reduced attack surface that wonâ€™t allow package installations or logins.
