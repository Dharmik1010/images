# Chainguard Container for static

Base images with the minimum contents needed to run static binaries.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/static:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Usage

Chainguard's static Image is meant to be used as a base image only and not intended to be run directly.

It can be used to host completely static binaries, such as those generated by `gcc`, `rust`, or `go`.

If you need images with the C standard library included, check out Chainguard's [glibc-dynamic](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/glibc-dynamic) Image.

This Image has a single user `nonroot` with uid `65532`, belonging to gid `65532`.

### Versioning

The static image is not versioned, since there's hardly any software in it that has a useful version. Most updates to the image are due to routine rebuilds of the packages included in the image, and don't constitute any functional change.

In general it should be safe to rely on the `:latest` or `:latest-glibc` tag, but you may also want to pin the image reference by digest and use a tool like [digestabot](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/digestabot) to automate image digest updates.

### Rust Dockerfile Example

This section outlines how to build a Rust static binary with Chainguard's static Image. First, create a Dockerfile named `Dockerfile.rust` with your preferred text editor.

```shell
nano Dockerfile.rust
```

Then add the following instructions to the file, which build a Rust static binary and put it into the static Image:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/rust as build

RUN echo 'fn main() { println!("Hello Rust users!"); }' > hello.rs
RUN rustc -C target-feature=+crt-static hello.rs

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest

COPY --from=build /work/hello /hello
CMD ["/hello"]
```

Save and close the file. To build the binary, run the following command:

```shell
docker build -t rusty-cgr --file Dockerfile.rust .
```

This command tags the binary with `rusty-cgr`. You can run this newly-built Image with the following command:

```shell
docker run rusty-cgr
```
```
Hello Rust users!
```

If you inspect this image, you'll find that it has a relatively small size:

```shell
docker images rusty-cgr
```
```
REPOSITORY   TAG   	IMAGE ID   	CREATED      	SIZE
rusty-cgr	latest	dd789eb1c964   35 seconds ago   3.98MB
```

### C Dockerfile Example

This section is similar to the previous one, but instead outlines how to build a C static binary. This time, create a Dockerfile named `Dockerfile.c` with your preferred text editor:

```shell
nano Dockerfile.c
```

Add the following instructions to the file:

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/gcc-glibc as build

COPY <<EOF /hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { printf("Hello C users!"); }
EOF
RUN cc -static /hello.c -o /hello

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest

COPY --from=build /hello /hello
CMD ["/hello"]
```

After saving and closing the Dockerfile, you can build the binary:

```shell
docker build -t c-cgr -f Dockerfile.c .
```

Then run it by referencing the tag `c-cgr`:

```shell
docker run c-cgr
```
```
Hello C users!
```

Inspect this newly-built image as well.

```shell
docker images c-cgr
```
```
REPOSITORY   TAG   	IMAGE ID   	CREATED      	SIZE
c-cgr    	latest	fc18c6e71f95   33 seconds ago   3.36MB
```

This C static binary is even smaller than the Rust one built in the previous section.

## What are Chainguard Containers?

[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/containers?utm_source=readmes) are minimal container images that are secure by default. 

In many cases, the Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Containers are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with a `-dev` variant.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to leverage the `-dev` variants, copying application artifacts into a final minimal container that offers a reduced attack surface that wonâ€™t allow package installations or logins.
