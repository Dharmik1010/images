# Chainguard Container for tomcat

[Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) is a free and open-source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Expression Language, and WebSocket technologies.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/tomcat:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes

The Chainguard Apache Tomcat image is meant to serve as a drop-in replacement for the official Tomcat image.

Like most of Chainguard's images, this image does not operate as the root user and includes only the minimum packages needed to function.

## Getting Started

To start up the `tomcat` server:

```shell
docker run cgr.dev/chainguard/tomcat:latest
```

This shows you the Apache Tomcat log output as the server boots, so you can check for any errors and confirm that Tomcat is running.

If you are running this container on your local machine for testing, you can modify the original `docker run` by forwarding requests to a port on your host machine to one of the container's ports. This enables you to connect to the Tomcat server using your host computer's browser:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 cgr.dev/chainguard/tomcat:latest
```

This again shows the Apache Tomcat log output as the server boots.

Now browse to `http://localhost:8080` to see an Apache Tomcat 404 error page. Tomcat will return a 404 error because, by default, Tomcat ships with an empty `webapps` directory. Regardless, what you will see is a confirmation that the Tomcat server is running.


## Documentation and Resources

You can find the official Tomcat documentation on [the Apache Tomcat website](https://tomcat.apache.org/).

## What are Chainguard Containers?

[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/containers?utm_source=readmes) are minimal container images that are secure by default. 

In many cases, the Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Containers are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with a `-dev` variant.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to leverage the `-dev` variants, copying application artifacts into a final minimal container that offers a reduced attack surface that wonâ€™t allow package installations or logins.
